      <li> The aim of the project is to find a better FEC coding schemes for a broadcast system that
can achieve both high overall successful data reception probability and low overall data
reception time with a range of channel condition.</li>
     <li>To analyze and investigate the performance of different forward error correction in a
broadcast system in terms of overhead bits, success data reception performance, channel
error tolerance, flexible switch off time.</li>
    </ul>
